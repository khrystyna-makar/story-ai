        {"story": "A simple, stuffed rabbit toy is given to a young boy as a Christmas present. At first, the rabbit isn't noticed, as the boy is distracted by much fancier gifts. While being ignored, the rabbit begins to wonder what it means to be “real.” One day, a certain event brings the rabbit into contact with the boy, and changes the toy's life forever. Have you ever loved a toy or doll so much, that you treated it as if it were alive? This story shows the power of love from a very unexpected viewpoint: that of a fluffy stuffed rabbit. It also highlights the importance of self-value, being true to yourself and finding strength in those who love you. "},
        {"story": "The year is 2081, and everyone has been made equal by force. Every person who is superior in any way has been handicapped (something that prevents a person's full use of their abilities) by the government. Intelligent people are distracted by disturbing noises. Good dancers have to wear weights so that they don't dance too well. Attractive people wear ugly masks so they don't look better than anyone else. However, one day there is a rebellion, and everything changes for a brief instant. Technology is always supposed to make us better. But in this case, we see that it can be used to disable our talents. Moreover, the writer shows us how the mindless use of a single value like equality can create more suffering for everyone."},
        {"story": "At first, the trees die. Then the snakes, followed by the tropical fish. Then the class gets a puppy, and… well, you can see where things are going.And that's just the beginning of the series of unfortunate events at the school in this short story, narrated by a teacher. The story is absurd (ridiculous to the point of being silly), even though the topic is serious. By the end, the kids start asking difficult questions about death that the adults don't quite know how to answer. This story leaves a lot of things unsaid, which means you'll need to “read between the lines,” or look closer at the text to understand what's really happening."},
        {"story": "One day, when a snake is about to attack Teddy, the Mongoose kills it. This event helps the family accept the mongoose into their family. This is a simple story about humans and animals living together as friends. It's old, but the language is fairly easy to understand. It reminds us that animals can also experience feelings of love and, like humans, they will also protect the ones they love. “Rikki-Tikki-Tavi” is part of Kipling's short story collection “The Jungle Book,” which was famously made into a movie by Disney."},
        {"story": "A man travels to a freezing, isolated place called Yukon with only his dog for company. Throughout his journey, he ignores the advice other people have given him and takes his life for granted. Finally, he realizes the real power of nature and how fragile (easily broken) human life actually is. Nature is often seen as a powerful force that should be feared and respected. The animal in this story is the one who's cautious and sensible in this dangerous situation. By the end, readers wonder who is really intelligent—the man who could not deal with nature, or the dog who could survive?"},
        {"story": "Sly is a chimpanzee who's much smarter than the other chimpanzees. He loves to play with clay on a potter's wheel all day and likes to keep to himself. But one day, when the school kids bully him, he loses his temper and acts out in anger. Seeing this, the teacher punishes him and takes away his clay.Sly is a character who doesn't fit into society. He's too smart for the other chimps, but humans don't accept him. He is punished for acting out his natural emotions. But the way he handles his rage, in the end, makes him look more mature than most human beings. Nominated for the Hugo award, many readers have connected with Sly since they can see similarities in their own lives."}
